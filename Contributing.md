# Contributing to AIC-Creative

Thank you for considering contributing to AIC-Creative.

This is not an entertainment project.
This is not a viral content factory.
This is not a dopamine engine.

AIC-Creative exists to explore art, music, and narrative as civilizational reconstruction tools.

If you are here to optimize engagement metrics, this is not the right place.
If you are here to deepen meaning and restore aesthetic integrity, welcome.
